												<h2>Our Story</h2>
										
											<section>
												<!-- <span class="image featured"><img src="images/mainh.png" alt="" /></span> --> 
												<p>
													We're two recent graduates of engineering in New York, looking to make a difference in our society. Our graduation and immediate post-college plans were unsurprisingly cancelled due to the pandemic, and we sought to use this time instead for good.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>

                                                    We're all aware of COVID-19's rapid (and continual) spread through the US, which is mainly through the spread of respiratory droplets, as well as un-sanitized surfaces.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>

                                                    The responsibility of sanitizing these surfaces comes down to the establishment, and while these precautions are necessary to keep spread down, they are difficult to maintain efficiently and at scale.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>

                                                    As our background is in mechanical engineering, we settled on developing a physical device to combat this surface transmission of viruses in high-touch areas. Out of the arena of possible high-touch areas to choose from, we chose the door handle to begin with, as it is a mechanical device whose problem aligns itself most closely with our background. Because of our engineering knowledge, we are able to develop a device that is low cost, easy to implement, easy to maintain, and easy to manufacture and distribute..
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>
												</p>

                                            <h2>Our Proposition and Competition</h2>

                                                    Our product is an add-on door handle that sanitizes itself each time the door is opened, and does not require any electronics.
                                                    <br> <br> 

                                                    In our early-stage today, the cost (energy and money) for customer feedback and product development is high, but as customer and product becomes more established, our costs will reduce and become more allocated towards scaling.
                                                    <br> <br> 

                                                    The mechanism in the door handle that we have developed is unique, and therefore we have first-mover advantage in the technology. However, there are a few other products in the market today that solve similar issues relating to opening a door without risk of infection. On the low-cost side, there are hand held devices to prevent hand to door contact, but this product still carries viruses and is left up to the responsibility of the individual. On the high end at $200 (+ installation), there is an electronic door handle with a sensor and plastic sleeve that cycles over the handle each time it's touched. As the cost of product goes up, the device becomes more easy to use, but does not necessarily solve the problem as well. Since our handle incorporates a CDC-recommended solution to disinfect the handle, it is a more complete solution for fighting the COVID virus.
